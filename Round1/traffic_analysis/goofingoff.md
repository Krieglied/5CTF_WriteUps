For this challenge, a pcap was provided to look at.

For question 1, "What common social media site was he surfing a lot?", I looked at the HTTP Request Sequences option, and noticed that reddit.com was coming up a lot.

For question 2, "What is the version of Windows being ran?", took a look at the user-agent for HTTP connections. Likely candiate was a Windows 7 with Chrome 41.

For question, "A website was visited that has a game on it - you can play on their site or download it. What was this site?", I looked at the HTTP objects that could be exported.
