A file that provided a long string of random characters.  Mostly consisted of alphabet characters, with a few special characters.
Each letter in the cipher either represented a 1 (uppercase) or 0 (lowercase). All special characters and spaces were junk, to be removed.  Convert the binary to ASCII for the flag.
